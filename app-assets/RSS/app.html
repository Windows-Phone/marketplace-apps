           <title>Re-Install All Your Apps with One Click</title>
           <description>
               <![CDATA[ <p>The concept behind <a shape="rect" href="http://www.allmyapps.com" shape="rect">AllMyApps.com</a> is genius. This website lets you create a list of all the applications you already have installed on your computer and saves that list so that you can re-install those apps at any time with just one click. If you’re formatting your PC in order to install a new OS, like say Windows 7 for example, a service like this could definitely come in handy as major timesaver. </p><p>That being said, the website still needs work. It seems they’re suffering from bandwidth issues at the moment – when I tried them this morning, the site was painfully slow. In fact, I thought it was down. I also was sad to discover that a lot of my most frequently used applications weren’t listed. For example, a search for “Windows Live” didn’t return results for any of the free Windows Live tools like Live Writer, Live Messenger, etc. And the results it did return were puzzling – why on earth would “Foxit Reader” or “AudioShell” be returned for this query? Clearly the search engine needs work, too. </p><p>Another problem – and one that probably couldn’t be avoided – is that AllMyApps.com won’t list any commercial software. That means you can’t include your Microsoft Office software or Adobe Photoshop in your list. You’ll still need to install those separately. Obviously, the reason for this is because those are not free programs, so listing them here would be akin to privacy, but it’s a bit disappointing that there isn’t some sort of workaround provided. For example, why not let you list them, but then have the installer prompt you at the end to insert the CD? That would at least keep the app re-installation flow going and could serve as a useful reminder, too. </p><p>It’s too bad that there were these sorts of issues because the concept alone had me genuinely excited. For now, I’ll keep my eye on this one and hope that they address some of these problems in the future. However, based on their <a shape="rect" href="http://getsatisfaction.com/allmyapps" shape="rect">GetSatisfaction page</a>, it appears the site has been running for nearly a year now, so I’m not getting my hopes up too high.</p><p>Does anyone know of a similar service? The only other one I could think of is <a shape="rect" href="http://ninite.com/" shape="rect">Ninite</a>, but that’s <em>really</em> limited in their selection.

           <description>
               <![CDATA[ <p>Thanks to Microsoft Student Partner <a shape="rect" href="http://twitter.com/aeoth" shape="rect">Paul Jenkins</a>, there’s a new Twitter client application to play with. The WPF-based app called <a shape="rect" href="http://www.theleagueofpaul.com/mahtweets/" shape="rect">MahTweets</a> is an attractive, feature-rich .NET Twitter client which includes support for a number of Twitter-related services like YFrog, Twitpic, and Twitgoo. In addition, it also supports Facebook and Flickr. </p><p>The application, now in its second version, is an update to an earlier app which originally relied on XMPP (Jabber) to deliver updates. When Twitter discontinued XMPP support, Jenkins decided to discontinue MahTweets, too. Eventually, he became frustrated when other desktop clients didn’t offer the features he wanted, so he “rebooted” the app with help from a few others as an <a shape="rect" href="http://mahtweets.codeplex.com/" shape="rect">open source</a>, multi-source network client.</p><p>As far as the Twitter functionality goes, MahTweets offers the standard options like viewing the timeline, replies, and the like. However, it also includes several unique features, too like filtering, auto-expanding shortened URLs, viewing in-line pictures, and automatic splitting of tweets longer than 140 characters. Future releases will include even more great features like webcam support, local searches, and themes. Other services like YouTube, TwitVid, and Blip.fm will also be introduced in future releases. </p><p>If you’re interested in trying MahTweets, you can install it from <a shape="rect" href="http://www.theleagueofpaul.com/mahtweets/" shape="rect">here</a>. </p><img src="http://m.webtrends.com/dcs1wotjh10000w0irc493s0e_6x1g/njs.gif?dcssip=channel9.msdn.com&dcsuri=http://channel9.msdn.com/Tags/app/RSS&WT.dl=0&WT.entryid=Entry:RSSView:1b91f4755bef49428e999e0e00f5fb60">]]></description>

The software, still under development, provides Windows users with a decent alternative to TweetDeck, an Adobe AIR app (and often a resource hog). In DigiTweet, you have a similar dashboard interface to that of TweetDeck which you can use to view and send tweets, read and reply to DMs, and more. It includes TinyURL and Twitpic support, too. </p><p>Of course, TweetDeck users will want columns for tracking their friends and searches – that is, in fact, the primary reason that TweetDeck became so popular after all.

Yes! <strong><em>A Twitter app designed for Windows 7! <br></em></strong></p><p>That’s especially good news since TweetDeck is the one and only application that doesn't seem to know how to behave properly in the beta operating system that is Windows 7.

Instead, I have to go to the system tray, right-click on the icon, and choose “Reset Window.” Combine that with the massive amount of memory it eats up – usually more than twice what my web browser is using – and I’ll admit that I’m thrilled to finally have an alternative application. </p><p>Although the version out now, available at <a shape="rect" href="http://digitweet.codeplex.com " shape="rect">digitweet.codeplex.com</a>, isn’t a complete TweetDeck replacement yet, it definitely sounds like the future version will be.

This tool already let you update your Facebook or Twitter status to reflect what you’re doing in Media Center <em>(ex: “is listening to…”, “is watching….”, etc.),</em>&nbsp; but now the app pulls in updates from your friends, too, and displays them on the screen. The updates appear in a pop-up window that appears at the bottom-right where it looks very much like the windows that appear when using native applications. Depending on how long the message is, the status updates will appear for anywhere from 5 to 10 seconds. The app’s <a shape="rect" href="http://www.kolumbus.fi/jussi.palo/FBMCE/ConfigTool/1.2.0.0/FBMCE_Configuration_Tool.zip" shape="rect">configuration tool</a> also lets you define the interval for how often updates are fetched from Twitter. (Don’t set this over 99 per hour as Twitter limits the queries to 100 times per hour.)

               <![CDATA[ <p><a href="http://www.veetosoft.com/uTodo.html">uTodo</a> is a small, lightweight, and portable version of Veetosoft’s more full-featuring GTD (“getting things done”) application called <a href="http://www.veetosoft.com/uOrganized.html">uOrganized</a>. The application is basically a task list and organizer, but it’s more feature-rich than many of the basic “to do” list programs out there as it allows for tons more customization options. You can use uTodo to track projects, assign priorities, attach notes to tasks, and tag actions. Those tasks can also be added to your desktop in the form of sticky notes that are virtually pasted onto your screen.

However, both of these apps are only worthy of serious GTD junkies as neither are available as freeware: uTodo is $19.95 and uOrganized is $34.95. Both include free updates for life, though. For more information on both apps, you can check out <a href="http://www.veetosoft.com/uo_demo.html">this video demo</a>.

           <title>Take Screenshots of your Phone with a Shake</title>
           <description>
               <![CDATA[If you blog about Windows Mobile, you probably use a utility that lets you grab screenshots of what’s showing on your device’s screen. There are a number of applications that do this, but <a href="http://pocketnow.com/index.php?a=portal_detail&amp;t=news&amp;id=6977">PocketNow</a> points out what may be one of the more fun options that’s out there. From Extreme Apps, a free utility called <a href="http://www.extreme-apps.com/ShakeAndSaveHome.php">Shake and Save</a> uses the G-Sensor found in Windows Mobile devices like the HTC Touch Diamond, HTC Touch Pro, HTC Touch HD and Samsung Omnia. With this app, taking a screenshot is as each as simply shaking your phone. Once installed, anytime you shake the device, it will automatically take a screenshot which can then be saved in one of four image formats: png, bmp, gif, or jpg. Shake and Save is available for download from <a href="http://www.extreme-apps.com/download.php?get=ShakeAndSave_Setup.cab">here</a>. <img src="http://m.webtrends.com/dcs1wotjh10000w0irc493s0e_6x1g/njs.gif?dcssip=channel9.msdn.com&dcsuri=http://channel9.msdn.com/Tags/app/RSS&WT.dl=0&WT.entryid=Entry:RSSView:223619232c684673a4499e0e00f00cdd">]]></description>

Within the application, there are buttons for the most recent and most viewed synths as well as a funny category called “nice and synthy,” which apparently means they have tons of photos per synth.

           <title>8hands&#58; Social Networking Desktop App for Windows Now in Beta</title>
           <description>
               <![CDATA[ <p><a href="http://www.8hands.com/">8hands</a> is a desktop client for Windows users that lets you track several social networking platforms including MySpace, Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, and YouTube. In a way, it’s sort of like FriendFeed without the need to set up an account – it just tracks your friends across the social web after you add in the services. </p><p>Just recently, 8hands released the beta version of their desktop application which adds in some new features like the ability to respond to tweets, write on the walls of your Facebook friends, and accept friend requests. </p><p>Unfortunately, as noted on <a href="http://www.downloadsquad.com/2009/01/26/8hands-social-networking-client-for-windows-goes-beta/">Download Squad</a>, the app doesn’t allow you to turn off the update notification sounds, which for a lot of us is kind of a deal breaker. (Let’s hope that someone from the company takes note of this issue and makes the correction.) Another issue is the app’s long install which requires a reboot. Crazy!

           <title>PhotoSuru, a Cool, Photo-Viewing WPF App</title>
           <description>
               <![CDATA[ <p>Adam Kinney just blogged about a new app called <a href="http://www.photosuru.com/">PhotoSuru</a>, a WPF sample application that lets you browse and share your photos. The app takes advantage of WPF features like Pixel Shaders, Adaptive Layout and Custom Themes. It’s designed to be more of a starter kit for developers who want to learn about WPF or build on top of what the app has to offer, but even on its own, it’s pretty cool. </p><p>PhotoSuru lets you display your photo albums as a filmstrip at the top of the screen with the larger photos displayed underneath. There are different views available – you can overlay descriptions or click more to see the photo and a longer rich text description beside the photo. You can also import subscriptions from a folder on your hard drive. You can even “drive” the app with a remote control! </p><p>For a video demonstration, check out this post on <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/Continuum/PhotoSuru/">Channel 9</a>. Or to visit the app itself, visit the <a href="http://www.photosuru.com/">PhotoSuru homepage</a>.&nbsp; </p><img src="http://m.webtrends.com/dcs1wotjh10000w0irc493s0e_6x1g/njs.gif?dcssip=channel9.msdn.com&dcsuri=http://channel9.msdn.com/Tags/app/RSS&WT.dl=0&WT.entryid=Entry:RSSView:21a938ba4e2243d3805e9e0e00289e9c">]]></description>

           <title>A Windows 7 Taskbar for XP</title>
           <description>
               <![CDATA[ <p>By now, you’ve surely seen the new <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/31242879@N00/2981796816/in/set-72157608452379413/">Windows 7 taskbar</a> which is one of the biggest UI changes in the upcoming OS. If you want to get a taste of that experience on your XP machine, you can check out <a href="http://solo-dev.deviantart.com/art/Windows-7-Taskbar-Iconizer-102860893">Iconizer</a>, a third party application that revamps the taskbar on XP PCs. The app changes the way the programs are displayed in the Windows taskbar from their default view of a minimized window to a view where only their icons are displayed. </p><p>Aesthetically, the effect is similar to Windows 7, although these icons are much smaller. Also, the app doesn’t offer the same kind of functionality as Windows 7 does like Aero Peek or jump lists. Still, it’s a nice way to keep a more cleaned up taskbar in XP while enjoying a bit of what Windows 7 will offer in the future. <em>(via </em><a href="http://www.ghacks.net/2009/01/02/windows-7-like-taskbar-in-windows-xp/"><em>gHacks</em></a><em>)</em></p><img src="http://m.webtrends.com/dcs1wotjh10000w0irc493s0e_6x1g/njs.gif?dcssip=channel9.msdn.com&dcsuri=http://channel9.msdn.com/Tags/app/RSS&WT.dl=0&WT.entryid=Entry:RSSView:1ca1aca810f94e0badf79e0e002853ad">]]></description>

           <title>A New Live Mesh App&#58; Flickr2Mesh</title>
           <description>
               <![CDATA[ <p>Whoa! This is cool. Developer <a href="http://sondreb.com/">Sondre Bjellås</a> has just released a Live Mesh-enabled application called Flickr2Mesh which automatically downloads your Flickr photos to your Windows Mobile Phone at whatever desired resolution you specify. Before you can use this application, you have to already be running Live Mesh, obviously, on both your desktop (<a href="http://www.mesh.com">www.mesh.com</a>) and mobile phone (<a href="http://m.mesh.com">m.mesh.com</a>).&nbsp; </p><p><em>Note: Live Mesh for mobile is currently only open to US and UK customers.</em></p><p>When Live Mesh installs on your phone, it will automatically create a folder called “Mobile Pictures.” In this folder, all the photos you can with your phone’s camera are synced with your PC. Sondre suggests creating a sub-folder within this folder called “Flickr” for the downloads from Flickr's online photo-sharing service.</p><p>Now you’re ready to download and install the Flickr2Mesh application. When you first launch the app, you’ll need to specify which folder is to be synchronized (ex: <em>C:\Users\Username\Desktop\Mobile Pictures\Flickr). </em>You’ll then need to authorize the app in Flickr by clicking the “Authorize” button provided.</p><p><a href="http://on10.net/Link/0883ed14-d0e4-4894-84e4-5a3746177cdf/"><img width="396" height="253" title="image.axd" alt="image.axd" src="http://on10.net/Link/2aac2456-113a-4589-b49f-ba2fd94e4592/" border="0"></a></p><p>You can now download your images from Flickr into your Mesh. There’s an option that allows you to pick what size you want your images to be when downloading. From the drop-down box provided, you can select Small, Medium, Large, or Original. Of course, since you’re downloading your images to your phone, you’ll most likely want to select “Small.&quot; </p><p><a href="http://on10.net/Link/f42fe39b-cc7c-4457-958f-4951be0559d4/"><img width="310" height="159" title="image3.axd" alt="image3.axd" src="http://on10.net/Link/d196d7b2-4216-4a13-b50d-6b987591fa77/" border="0"></a></p><p>Finally, just click “Download.” Next thing you know, all your Flickr photos will have been added to your Mesh, in the right size for viewing on your mobile device. Now you'll be able to view your photos on the go, without having to browse to the Flickr.com web site itself. </p><p>You can download and install the Flickr2Mesh application from Sondre’s SkyDrive <a href="http://azjrcw.bay.livefilestore.com/y1pXgjA_r-za-XBV5vgc5a-5wvQiF8Kc2qZPIXNygh2kPMd81oZE3O5aaO18gVTVO7zPiEqIPMcXvs/Flickr2Mesh_Release.zip?download">here</a> (zip file).

           <title>Gestures&#38;hellip&#59;The New Touch&#63;</title>
           <description>
               <![CDATA[ <p>Gestures are getting hot, <a shape="rect" href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/10/08/microsoft-office-labs-releases-touchless-multi-touch-as-an-open-source-sdk/" shape="rect">are they not</a>? Lately, I’ve noticed a bunch of apps that let you use mouse gestures to execute predefined commands or actions. But this is hardly a new trend…apps like <a shape="rect" href="http://www.tcbmi.com/strokeit/" shape="rect">StrokeIt</a>, the Windows-only global mouse gestures app were <a shape="rect" href="http://lifehacker.com/software/mouse/download-of-the-day-strokeit-windows-250735.php" shape="rect">getting attention</a> as far back as spring 2007. So why the resurgence now, I wonder? </p><p>I’ve recently come across freeware like <a shape="rect" href="http://www.winmatrix.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=18983" shape="rect">Mazzrick</a>, a portable mouse gesture utility that lets you create your own custom gestures, and the full-featured <a shape="rect" href="http://www.handform.net/gmote.php" shape="rect">gMote</a> which, in addition to being portable, supports over 30 actions. </p><p>Given the usability of these freeware/donationware programs, I’m not sure why someone would pay for a mouse gestures app, but <a shape="rect" href="http://www.mouse-gesture.com/products/mouse_gesture_application_launcher_mglaunch.html" shape="rect">mgLaunch</a> ($29.95) is hoping you will. Their app launcher is skinnable, so maybe that’s what makes it worth it? I’m not sure, but it also crossed my radar not too long ago, so it may be worth a look.&nbsp; </p><p><a shape="rect" href="http://on10.net/Link/bec45e93-e689-47f2-ac32-7bb00360a333/" shape="rect"><img width="362" height="184" width="362" height="184" title="mgLaunch" alt="mgLaunch" src="http://on10.net/Link/b3ff42e2-a949-4cdc-884a-3b083813445d/" border="0"></a></p><p>Another gesture-based utility is the IE plugin called simply “<a shape="rect" href="http://www.ysgyfarnog.co.uk/utilities/MouseGestures/" shape="rect">Mouse Gestures for Internet Explorer</a>.” With this software, you can control various tasks related to your web surfing – like opening and closing windows -&nbsp; just by drawing a simple symbol on the screen. (Works with XP/Vista/64-bit,&nbsp; too).</p><p>But with computers getting smaller and more portable, I would think more people are using the touchpad than the mouse. Still, the netbook phenomenon may have people starting to pack a mini mouse to go, too, since those netbook touchpads are crazy small. </p><p>Are you a fan of mouse gesture applications? If so, feel free to share which ones you like and recommend in the comments. </p><img src="http://m.webtrends.com/dcs1wotjh10000w0irc493s0e_6x1g/njs.gif?dcssip=channel9.msdn.com&dcsuri=http://channel9.msdn.com/Tags/app/RSS&WT.dl=0&WT.entryid=Entry:RSSView:299165acc12142d582779e0e001c7773">]]></description>

           <description>
               <![CDATA[ <p>Have you been eying the new Windows 7 features with envy? Well, now you can get at least one of them on your Vista computer: <strong>Aero Shake</strong>. Over at <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5082279/aero-shake-clears-your-pre&#43;windows-7-desktop">LifeHacker</a>, they’ve released an app that lets you shake your active window to minimize all the other open windows, just like in Windows 7. Shake again, and the other windows will be restored. Simply called the Shake app, the software was written in AutoHotkey and <a href="http://lifehacker-coders.googlegroups.com/web/AeroShake&#43;(2).ahk?gda=qg6CTEcAAADTjHbCFKywrQH2lPYUuICOHZHPnB_H-NKI2umzdMKZThz6VpzrTMntFph4KUczMip2kNxZBBOFgSkXf-lm4TxpeV4duv6pDMGhhhZdjQlNAw">the source code</a> is available for addition to your main AHK script if desired. But for most of us, the <a href="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/lifehacker/2008/11/Aero_Shake.exe">downloadable .exe file</a> will work better.</p><p>Before you download, though, be aware that this app is still a little “rough around the edges” they warn, and some commenters have reported issues with its use. In our tests, it worked OK, but maybe a little slow. It also hid the sidebar! However, it definitely gets us excited to get our hands on Windows 7 so we can finally enjoy the <em>real </em>Aero Shake and all its other cool features too. <em>(Image </em><a href="http://lifehacker.com/5077379/new-aero-shake-clears-the-windows-7-desktop"><em>via</em></a><em>)</em></p><img src="http://m.webtrends.com/dcs1wotjh10000w0irc493s0e_6x1g/njs.gif?dcssip=channel9.msdn.com&dcsuri=http://channel9.msdn.com/Tags/app/RSS&WT.dl=0&WT.entryid=Entry:RSSView:a2816a0959594d8cb2609e0e001bd662">]]></description>

           <title>Snooze UAC With A New App</title>
           <description>
               <![CDATA[ <p>We’ve heard that Windows 7 will bring us a kinder, gentler version of Vista’s User Account Control (UAC), a security service which pops up windows asking for permission when you try run .exe files, make system changes, access restricted files, or perform other actions that could impact your computer’s safety and stability. However, until we have Windows 7, Vista users can take advantage of a new utility for temporarily disabling UAC – without a reboot! </p><p>The new app <a href="http://http://www.uacsnooze.com">UAC Snooze</a> lets you temporarily shut off UAC prompts by clicking on the icon it installs in your system tray. The app is available as a free trial for 30 days, then, to continue using it, a one-time fee of $5 is required. </p><p><span>UAC Snooze provides the following features:</span></p><ul><li>Temporarily turn off UAC prompts by clicking on the UAC Snooze icon in the system tray </li><li>Can be configured to start automatically with Windows and not require a UAC prompt </li><li>Clicking on the icon can turn off UAC prompts or snooze for 1, 5, 10, 30 or 60 minutes (or user-defined time) </li><li>10 user-defined snooze intervals can be defined </li><li>Right-click on icon to bring up menu to select action other than the default </li><li>When prompts are off, click on icon again to turn prompts back on </li><li>Options to modify prompt action when program opens and closes </li><li>Tooltip shows time remaining until prompts will be turned back on </li><li>Icon changes based on state (Prompts On: UAC Shield , Snooze: Shield with a Z , Off: Shield with an X) </li></ul><p>UAC Snooze works on both 32 and 64 bit systems and can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.uacsnooze.com/">here</a>. </p><p><em>(via <a href="http://www.askvg.com/uac-snooze-turn-off-windows-vista-uac-prompts-on-the-fly/">AskVG</a>)</em></p><img src="http://m.webtrends.com/dcs1wotjh10000w0irc493s0e_6x1g/njs.gif?dcssip=channel9.msdn.com&dcsuri=http://channel9.msdn.com/Tags/app/RSS&WT.dl=0&WT.entryid=Entry:RSSView:130c362378584166930f9e0e001bc007">]]></description>

           <title>TweetyBot&#58; A New Twitter Client For Windows PCs</title>
           <description>
               <![CDATA[ <p>I just came across <a href="http://www.tweetybot.com">TweetyBot</a>, a new Twitter desktop application for users of Windows XP or Vista. This small app includes a lot of features – even more than my everyday Twitter client, <a href="http://www.twhirl.org">Twhirl</a>. Across the top of <a href="http://tweetybot.com/">TweetyBot</a> are several tabs which allow you to see the usual views – your tweets, replies, directs, etc. However, TweetyBot also includes several additional options for managing your tweets. For example, there’s an “Ignore List” tab where you can enter in someone’s Twitter username and ignore them without actually blocking or unfollowing them: </p><p><a href="http://on10.net/Link/6b232187-a6e5-4f04-834c-2e7d45349e10/"><img width="355" height="79" title="tweety_bot_ignore" alt="tweety_bot_ignore" src="http://on10.net/Link/6a508f80-8889-42fe-8356-c483ad0633e0/" border="0"></a>&nbsp;</p><p>But one of the best features is the “Alert List” tab. Here, you can enter in your favorite twitterers' usernames and you’ll get pop-up desktop alerts when they update their status. The client includes a few other features, too, like separate “Following” and “Followers” tabs and tweet threading for following individual conversations. </p><p><a href="http://on10.net/Link/b4bd7569-10db-4d1f-8d7e-74381c5f7c3e/"><img width="77" height="78" title="tweety_bot_icon" alt="tweety_bot_icon" src="http://on10.net/Link/3a001a62-d19b-4188-9232-3d9eb0125a6f/" align="right" border="0"></a> Still, there are a few issues with this app that it’s worth noting. For one, the “Options” tab and “Tweet Manager” tab appeared completely blank for me. I don’t know if those are upcoming features or if this is just a bug, but I found that odd. Also, links always opened in IE and there didn’t appear to be any options for setting an alternative browser <em>(or maybe there were, but I just couldn’t see them in my empty Options tab!)</em>. The client is ad-supported and features a somewhat large banner at the bottom of the app's window. I understand the need to make money, but I found the ad just a bit obtrusive. </p><p>According to the TweetyBot homepage, there are a few upcoming features that look interesting, though, like a tweet auto responder, a tweet scheduler, and an auto-follow option. There’s also a cool auto-UNfollow feature coming which will automatically unfollow someone after you follow them and they don’t reciprocate. You’ll be able to set the time frame for this option. </p><p>Although <a href="http://tweetybot.com/">TweetyBot</a> is new, it has a lot of features that could make it a great, feature-rich client for Windows users. Hopefully, they will iron out some of the kinks I experienced before too long. If so, I’ll definitely take another look at this one. I might even switch from Twhirl…maybe…</p><img src="http://m.webtrends.com/dcs1wotjh10000w0irc493s0e_6x1g/njs.gif?dcssip=channel9.msdn.com&dcsuri=http://channel9.msdn.com/Tags/app/RSS&WT.dl=0&WT.entryid=Entry:RSSView:8df7ffacaf1f41f8b94e9e0e00269a2b">]]></description>
